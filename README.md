  A portable desktop console for CLIProxyAPI.<br>
  Our goal is to make tokens free—as in freedom.
</p>

## Overview

EasyCLIProxyAPI is a graphical desktop management tool built on
[CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI). It brings core lifecycle management,
OAuth authorization, API provider aggregation, protocol conversion, credential management,
quota inspection, usage records, model aliases, and agent client configuration into one interface.

The application is built with Tauri, React, and Rust. It can carry a matching CLIProxyAPI core
archive, making first-time setup and offline installation easier.

Thanks to APIMart for sponsoring this project!

APIMart is a low-cost API platform for AI image & video generation — GPT-Image-2 from $0.006/image, 160+ images per dollar. One async API covers both image and video: submit a task, get an ID, fetch results via polling or callback. Batch tens of thousands of images without timeouts, switch models without changing code.

## Feature Tour

### Home dashboard and local API endpoints

![Home dashboard and local API endpoints](docs/screenshots/en/1.png)

The Home page provides a quick overview of the local proxy runtime and ready-to-use API endpoints:

- Start, stop, restart, and refresh the CLIProxyAPI core.
- View installation state, runtime state, process ID, and listening port.
- Copy ready-to-use OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini-compatible API endpoints.
- Check local connectivity and the application/core version at a glance.

Core installation, version comparison, and offline installation are available from the
**Version Management** page. You can switch between official GitHub, GitCode, and GitHub
mirror proxies or add custom HTTPS mirror prefixes; application and core updates prefer the selected
channel and fall back automatically.

Application and core updates are each checked once in the background at startup, then automatically
on every fifth visit to **Version Management** (visits 5, 10, 15, and so on). Their respective
**Check for Updates** buttons remain available for manual checks. Re-renders do not count as visits,
and restarting the application resets the counter. Changing download sources does not trigger a
check, and reopening the page preserves the saved source. Checks do not automatically download or
install updates.

### OAuth account authorization

![OAuth account authorization](docs/screenshots/en/2.png)

The OAuth page centralizes browser-based authorization for supported providers:

- Codex OAuth
- Claude OAuth
- Antigravity OAuth
- Kimi OAuth
- xAI OAuth

EasyCLIProxyAPI opens the authorization page in the browser and supports completing the callback
flow when an automatic redirect is unavailable.

### API provider aggregation

![API provider aggregation](docs/screenshots/en/3.png)

The provider workspace manages upstream API credentials and endpoints by protocol or provider:

- Codex
- OpenAI-compatible providers
- DeepSeek
- Claude
- Gemini

You can add multiple connections, search existing entries, refresh provider state, and use them
through the unified local CLIProxyAPI endpoint. Requests and responses can be converted between
supported OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and compatible formats.

### Optional MonkeyCode signing

Use the existing **OpenAI**, **Codex**, or **Claude** API access entry for the upstream
protocol. In **Advanced settings**, set `signing_secret` to the complete paired `omas_...`
value (including the prefix, without Base64 decoding). Leave it blank to disable signing.
Signing requires one API key and an explicit Base URL, using the usual protocol URL format:
OpenAI/Codex typically end in `/v1`; Claude uses the service root. Select the models offered
by that upstream, or add their names manually if model discovery is unavailable.

The bundled stock CLIProxyAPI still handles protocol conversion. An in-process loopback
bridge signs the final outgoing system prompt with HMAC-SHA256 and streams the response.
The original protocol and request body are preserved. The bridge removes all URL query
parameters, including the core's automatic `beta=true`, before forwarding to MonkeyCode.
HTTP/SSE is supported; signing disables
Codex WebSocket transport. Requests need a non-empty system prompt, and health checks include
one in the appropriate protocol format.

Keep the desktop app running. Local bridge addresses are refreshed before the core starts.
Upstream proxy settings are honored. Credentials are stored in core configuration, with
bridge metadata encoded in a reserved header (not encrypted). This header is removed before
forwarding. Do not share `config.yaml`.

### Usage history and token analytics

![Usage history and token analytics](docs/screenshots/en/4.png)

The Usage page helps you understand local request activity and token consumption:

- Review request totals, token counts, success rate, throughput, cache hit rate, and estimated cost.
- Filter usage by time, model, provider, source, key, and result.
- Inspect request/token trends and input, output, reasoning, and cache usage.
- Browse request details, analysis views, and price statistics.
- Collect through CPA's real-time usage subscription with a durable local inbox and automatic HTTP fallback.
- Upgrade legacy usage databases once at startup after saving a backup under `usage-records/backups`.

### Agent client configuration

![Agent client configuration](docs/screenshots/en/5.png)

The Agents page detects installed desktop and CLI clients and helps connect them to the local
proxy. Supported clients include:

- Claude Code
- Claude Desktop
- Codex
- OpenCode
- OpenClaw
- Hermes Agent
- Pi (with the CLIProxyAPI provider extension)
- ZCode
- Kimi Code
- Grok Build

For supported clients, the application can synchronize the available model catalog, select a
default model, back up the original configuration before applying managed settings, and restore the
previous configuration.

## Additional Capabilities

- Manage core settings, API keys, remote management credentials, and routing strategy.
- Create client-visible model aliases and map them to provider models and reasoning levels.
- Upload, download, inspect, and manage authentication files.
- Review provider quotas and account availability.
- Keep the application available from the macOS menu bar or Windows system tray.

## Quick Start

1. Download the package for your operating system from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yinsel/EasyCLIProxyAPI/releases/latest).
2. Extract the Windows or Linux archive, or open the macOS DMG.
3. Launch EasyCLIProxyAPI.
4. Open **Version Management** and install the bundled or latest CLIProxyAPI core.
5. Return to **Home**, start the core, then copy the required local endpoint or configure an OAuth/API provider.

## Upgrading

Every Windows release publishes both the complete ZIP and the legacy `update` ZIP. This keeps in-app updates available to older clients that have not migrated yet, while newer clients use the complete package so the bundled core can be updated too.

Current Windows, Linux, and macOS release packages support in-app automatic updates. Linux replaces the portable application files while preserving runtime data, and macOS replaces the signed application bundle. Each platform waits for the new version to confirm a successful launch and rolls back automatically if startup fails. The installation directory must be writable by the current user.

Existing Linux and macOS installations need one manual upgrade to a release that includes the cross-platform auto-update marker. In-app updates are available after that release has been launched once.

If you are running v0.2.5 or earlier, perform one manual migration: exit EasyCLIProxyAPI, download the latest complete Windows ZIP for your architecture, then copy the contents of its top-level directory over the existing installation directory. Do not delete the existing directory first; user data such as `config.toml`, `oauth`, and `cpa-core/config.yaml` will remain in place. After launching the new version, later releases can use in-app automatic updates.

## Supported Platforms

GitHub Actions builds the following release packages:

| Operating System | Architecture | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | amd64, aarch64 | ZIP |
| macOS | amd64, aarch64 | DMG |
| Linux | amd64, aarch64 | TAR.GZ |
